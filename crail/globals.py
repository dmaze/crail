.. data:: current_player

   :class:`crail.models.Player` object for the current session, or
   :const:`None` if not logged in.

   Note that this is a Werkzeug local proxy holding only a weak reference
   to the object!  In particular, this means that using `current_player`
   as one side of a relationship in other :mod:`crail.models` objects
   can result in SQLAlchemy problems.  Assigning its value to a local
   variable gets around this.
